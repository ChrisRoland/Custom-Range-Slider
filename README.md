# Custom Range Slider

![project screenshot](image-1.png)

A beautifully designed and interactive custom range slider built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how to style a range input element, display dynamic values, and implement a smooth background gradient effect based on the slider's position. It’s a great starting point for enhancing user experience in forms and interactive applications.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Label Positioning**: The label dynamically adjusts its position above the slider to follow the thumb as it moves.
- **Background Gradient Effect**: The slider's background fills with a gradient as the value increases.
- **Custom Thumb Design**: The slider thumb is styled for a sleek and modern look.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (with custom styling for the slider and thumb).
- **JavaScript**: Handles dynamic label positioning and gradient updates.
